# Infinitious

Infinitious is a web application that implements infinite scroll functionality, providing users with a seamless browsing experience akin to social media platforms. As the user scrolls near the bottom of the page, new images are dynamically loaded, creating the impression of endless scrolling. The application features a loading animation to indicate when new content is being fetched. Images are fetched from the Unsplash API, ensuring a diverse and high-quality selection. As the user approaches the bottom of the page, the scroll bar jumps up to signify the loading of more images. Hovering over an image displays its description, while clicking on an image redirects users to the Unsplash website, where they can view more details about the photo, including the author's information, and download the image if desired. The website is fully mobile-responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across devices. Please note that the website has a limit of 50 requests per hour to the Unsplash API.
