# Infius
Infius is to the implement of infinite scroll functionality. This is something happens on social media as the user scrolls near the bottm of the page. It feels like you're seamlessly scrolling forever.<br>
It includes loading animation.<br>
The photos are fetchedfrom the Unsplash's API.<br>
When we get closer to the bottom, scroll bar jump up when the next network request is made and fetching more images.<br>
If we hover an image, it shows the description.<br>
If we click on the image, it redirects you to the website, here you can see author of the image and can download that image if you want.<br>
This website is also mobile responsive as well.<br>
